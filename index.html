            <img class="about-Image" src="Images/TimPicture.png" width="500" height="300">
            <p class="about"> Since I was young, I loved to play video games with my friends and brother, the graphics, the challenges, the way the characters walked around while I was on the other side of the screen using a controller, I was just amazed by it. Until this day my ambition has been to be able to create worlds like the ones I loved as a kid.</p>
            <p class="about">My name is Albert White and I have dedicated half of my life to study, and comprehend the dynamics behind video games; as much as I love the music, the graphics, the design of characters, my curiosity lead me to what and how things are crated, that's the main reason why I decided to prepare myself as a game developer, I am originally from Guatemala, but at 13 years old I moved to Texas and of course my passion for video games only grew.</p>
            <p class="about">By the time I was 15 one of my best friends motivated me to follow my passion, and so I did, I helped him by creating some of the maps he used for his first game, that was the green light I needed to choose this career as my path in life. Since I was still in high school the only thing I could do was try to make myself ready for the real world, so I took a programing and coding class where I learned all the basics I needed. (C#).</pclass="about">
            <p class="about">Once I got out of high school my mind was set on the idea of going to Full 'Sail University but thanks to covid I had to pause that dream for a while, in the meantime I kept filling myself with knowledge, using books, courses online and everything I could to make myself better. On 2022 my dream became a reality when I was admitted into Full Sail University, all those years of hard work paid off.</p>
            <p class="about">Once at Full Sail I master C#, C++ , Unity, Unreal engine, perforce, GitHub, in between others, now I have the tools I need to keep making my dreams come true, making my first video game with my colleagues was an incredible experience, Full Sail gave me everything I needed to be a great game developer, for now I'm working alongside my colleagues planning and gathering ideas to try and create a new game. I reside in Houston, TX. But "The greatest adventure is what lies ahead". -J.R.R. Tolkien and I'm all ready to move.</p>
            <p class="about">What I'm looking for is a place where I can grow as a person and in knowledge, a place where I can work hard and be part of a team, a place to improve myself as a game developer.</p>
